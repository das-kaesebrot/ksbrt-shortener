# About
This project aims to create a simple and fast self-hosted URL shortening service (possibly also providing a REST API) utilizing the Spring framework and some sort of database connection all being written in Java - as a challenge to myself and to improve my programming skills.

Once it is done, the service will be deployed to a server serving the [ksbrt.de](https://ksbrt.de) domain.
